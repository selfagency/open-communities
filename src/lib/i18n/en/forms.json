	"intro.1": "Many Jews are feeling disconnected from their home communities, or even Judaism writ large. Rabbis for Ceasefire will share a directory in Elul of congregations that are intentionally welcoming Jews in the ceasefire movement to join them for the High Holidays.",
	"intro.2": "There is no requirement for congregations to have made public statements supporting a permanent ceasefire to be listed in this directory. Our general guideline is that as your High Holidays team prepares for the season, the spiritual needs of Jews calling for permanent ceasefire will be considered and included in the planning process.",
	"intro.3": "We will continue to update this directory with new submissions on a weekly basis until the High Holidays."
